********UPI Expense Categoriser********

This project aims at solving the problem of categorising UPI payments using AI. The Idea stemmed out when I was spending money through UPI on apps like PhonePe and Paytm but was not able categorise the payments.
For example, If I was spending ðŸ’µ30/- on banana's I'd have that transaction recorded in my transactions tab inside PhonePe or paytm, but the problem here is it's hard to recognise seeing just the transaction to determine the purpose of that payment. Since a long time most of the vendors register themselves to payment gateways with their own name and not their business names, it becomes harder for us(consumers) to recognise a transaction during reconciliation.

I'm going to use Artificial intelligence and web scraping in this project.
